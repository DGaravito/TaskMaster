# Welcome to TaskMaster!

TaskMaster is a Python-based program for running common experimental tasks. TaskMaster is built only using Python, 
specifically using Numpy, Pandas, PyQt6, SciPy, and XlsxWriter. Currently, Taskmaster includes 15 tasks:

- Ambiguous Risk Taking Task
- Risk Aversion Task
- Risky-Choice Framing Task
- Delay Discounting Task
- Probability Discounting Task
- Cognitive Effort Discounting Task
- Perceptual Bias Task
- Negative Attentional Capture Task
- Stop Signal Task
- Emotional Go/No-Go Task
- Go/No-Go Task
- Paired Recall Memory Test
- n-Back Task (1, 2, 3, and 4)
- Beads Task
- Stroop Task
- Digit Span Task
- Dwell Task

Note: I do not include any emotional or otherwise valenced stimuli (i.e., that one would use in the Emo Go/No-Go or 
Dwell tasks) with my program. In the future, I plan to have my own preformatted picture repository set up to use with 
TaskMaster that people could use if they would like. For now, for the Emo Go/No-Go or Dwell tasks, I would advise you 
to go to any group that compiles pictures of faces and other valenced stimuli. Before you can use them with TaskMaster, 
you will have to make sure the pictures are in PNG format and named like below:

- Fearful_M_NW_1.png - This is a picture of the first non-white male in our stimuli making a fearful face.
- Fearful_M_NW_2.png - This is a picture of the second non-white male, also making a fearful face.
- Sad_M_NW_1.png - This is another picture of the first non-white male, who is now making a sad face.
- Angry_F_W_1.png - This is a picture of the first white female making an angry face.
- Neutral_F_NW_1.png - This is a picture of the first non-white female making a neutral face.
- NFNeutral_1.png - This is a picture of our first neutral non-face.
- NFNegative_1.png - This is a picture of our first negative non-face.

## Coming soon!

If you want a task designed, please let me know!

We previously featured [ADOPy](https://docs.adopy.org/en/stable/) in several tasks. However, we no longer can 
incorporate it because lack of maintenance has led to deprecated code. In the future, I may try to add my own code that 
performs ADOPy's intended purpose. Alternatively, if the code is updated by the original developers, I may reintroduce 
it into TaskMaster.

## Installation

1. Download latest release, depending on your operating system.
2. Run the installer (or double-click the .dmg file for MacOS) to install the program.

## Usage

When you start TaskMaster, you will be able to select one of many tasks. Click on one, fill out the appropriate 
settings, and then submit the settings to run the task.

## Contributing

Please report any bugs you may find and provide any feedback you have regarding TaskMaster. I am always open to 
suggestions, and I want to make TaskMaster as available and useful as possible for everyone!

Pull requests are also welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
